# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China. I received a BS in Software Engineering from the Nanjing University of Post and Telecommunication, China, in 2009.6. I got my Master and Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Jian Lu from Nanjing University in 2012.6 and 2017.12, respectively. I worked with Prof. Chenxiang Zhai as a visiting student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA, between 2014.10--2015.10. I joined the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University, as an assistant/associate researcher, between 2017.12--2024.02. 

# Research

**Advanced Reasoning with Large Language Models**
* Automated Theorem Proving with Large Language Models
* Executable Reasoning in Large Language Models

**Domain Knowledge Integration for Large Language Models**
* Advanced Knowledge Integration for Large Language Models
* Modular Composition via Hot-plugging
<!-- LLM-based applications demand not only strong reasoning capabilities but also efficient integration of diverse domain knowledge. Existing approaches, such as fine-tuning and PEFT-based modules, often struggle with multi-domain and cross-disciplinary tasks, especially in selecting and combining multiple knowledge modules dynamically. Current systems typically support only single-module adaptation and lack mechanisms for scalable, user-aware knowledge activation. To address this, we explore modular and extensible frameworks that enable LLMs to continuously incorporate and reason over heterogeneous third-party knowledge modules, advancing the flexibility and applicability of LLM-driven software systems. -->

**Infrastructure and Parallelism Technologies for Large Language Model Training and Inference**
* Advanced Parallelism Technologies for Large Language Models Training
* Unified Training and Inference for Large Language Models
* Low-precision Floating Point Training and Inference

<!-- We study the capabilities of large language models in formal reasoning tasks, with a focus on automated theorem proving (ATP). Our research aims to enhance the reasoning depth, consistency, and proof traceability of LLMs by integrating symbolic structures, search-based strategies, and data generation techniques. We develop methods that enable LLMs to interact with formal systems, perform logical deductions, and generate verifiable proofs in diverse domains. This work contributes to the broader goal of building AI systems capable of robust, interpretable, and mathematically grounded reasoning. -->

# Teaching

Currently, I am taching the course "从零手搓大语言模型 (Programming Large Language Models from Scratch)" in Nanjing University. You could find the [lecture](https://njudeepengine.github.io/llm-course-lecture/) and the [assignments](https://github.com/NJUDeepEngine/llm-assignments). I also teach "Introduction of Algorithm Design & Analysis".
